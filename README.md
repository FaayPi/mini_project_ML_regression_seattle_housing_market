# 🏡 House Price Prediction | Mini Project

This project explores **machine learning regression** techniques to predict house prices in King County, Washington (Seattle area) using a dataset of ~22,000 properties sold between **May 2014 – May 2015**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Predict house prices based on property features.  
- Identify factors influencing higher property values (≥ $650K).  
- Compare multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Use **Tableau** for interactive data exploration and visual insights.  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [House Sales in King County](./data/)  
- Includes features such as `price`, `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `grade`, `condition`, and more.  
- ~22K rows, 21 features.  

---

## 🔧 Workflow
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** → Handle nulls, encode categoricals, scale numerical features.  
2. **Modeling** → Train and evaluate regression models (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²).  
3. **Visualization** → Use Tableau dashboards to analyze house characteristics and trends.  
4. **Presentation** → Summarize findings and best-performing model.  

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- Python code (EDA + ML models).  
- Tableau Dashboard.  
- SQL queries for business questions.  
- Final slide deck & presentation.

## ✅ Key Insight
Tree-based ensemble models (**Gradient Boosting, Random Forest**) outperform linear models, effectively capturing **nonlinear relationships** and **outliers** in housing data.
